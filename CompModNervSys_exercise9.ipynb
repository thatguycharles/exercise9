        "1) Implement conductance based models of fast excitatory (AMPA) and inhibitory (GABAA) synapses\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Understand how dendrites spatially and temporally filter synaptic inputs \n",

        "3) Describe the divisive and subtractive properties of shunting inhibition\n",
        "\n",
        "Neurons receive thousands of synapses distributed along their dendritic trees, each of which genereate either excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic currents that act to increase or decrease, respectively, the postsynaptic potential. At any given moment, neurons are bombarded by tens of thousands of synaptic currents pulling the membrane voltage up and down throughout their extended arbors, culminating in the generation of action potentials when the action potential threshold voltage (remember, not a fixed value!) is reached at the soma and axon initial segment. \n",
        "\n",
        "It may seem as though all these complicated interactions are just a prelude to the single important \"decision\" made by the neuron, whether or not to fire an AP. Indeed, early computational work and modern artificial neural networks treat neurons as simple integrators (i.e., non-leaky integrate and fire), simply summing their inputs and generating an output once a threshold is crossed, but how closely does this picture resemble real neurons? \n",
        "\n",
        "It turns out the combination of dendritic cable properties and synaptic conductance changes leads to a variety of intradendritic computations, allowing for amplification, vetoing, modulation, mixing, and more, of the information a neuron receives throughout its elaborate dendritic architecture. In this exercise, we'll explore just a couple of questions along this vein: How does the location and timing of a synaptic input alter its effects on the postsynaptic neuron's output? How do excitatory and inhibitory inputs interact to generate the net output? \n",

This will allow us to simulate synaptic inputs at different locations within the dendrite.

For the purposes of this exercise, this would serve as an additional complication, so we'll turn off this functionality and make the synapse deterministic (i.e., release probability of 1). You may also notice from the name, it includes both AMPA and NMDA conductance. Most glutamatergic synapses (excitatory synapses that use glutamate as their neurotransmitter) do contain both AMPA and NMDA receptors on the postsynaptic side, which are both activated at the same time by presynaptic glutamate release, making this a convenient computational approach to implementing glutamatergic synapses. We won't need the NMDA conductance for this exercise; however, one of the other reasons we're using this mechanism is because we will make use of this NMDA conductance in exercise 10, so stay tuned. \n",

We'll start by adding a single AMPAergic synapse that we'll call `ampa_syn` to the middle of the dendrite (`x = 0.5`). We can then set the synaptic time constants, which are named `tau_r_AMPA` and `tau_d_AMPA`, and reversal potential, just named `e`. Finally, since we want a purely AMPAergic synapse, we turn off the NMDA component by setting `NMDA_ratio` to 0. Run the code block below before proceeding.  "

        "Now that we have some intuition for a baseline condition in which a single EPSP was applied, generating ~1.5 mV peak potential in the soma. Let's explore some key properties of conductance based synapses. First, we'll address the question is the voltage change generated by a synapse linear to the synaptic weight? Or, an equivalent way of asking this question is if the voltage change is linear to the number of synapses activated. This is because we can model multiple, synchronous synapses at the same compartment as the summation of each of their conductances (think of adding more conductances in our parallel conductance model). \n",

        "To answer this, we'll run the same simulation we ran above in a loop while varying the synaptic weight and measuring the voltage traces at the soma. We can then extract the peak of the EPSP to assess the magnitude of postsynaptic voltage change. Since we'll do a couple experiments like this in which we sweep over a variable and extract voltage recordings and peak PSPs, I've written `plot_PSP_sweep` to plot the postsynaptic potential traces overlaid and the peak PSP vs. the variable we're changing (in this case the synaptic weight).

A widely held, but still hotly debated view, is that neuron's encode and transmit information in their firing rates. So it would seem crucial to also understand how inhibitory synapses affect the neuron's firing rate.\n",

We'd like to know how the input-output properties of the neuron are altered in the presence of shunting inhibition. As we did before, we'll characterize this using the *frequency-input* curve by measuring the firing rate (in Hz) as a function of constant current input. We could use excitatory synaptic inputs instead but things unnecessarily complicated for now.\n",

Start the synaptic inputs at $0 \\; ms$. This may seem high, but keep in mind, neurons receive thousands of synaptic inputs, all of which may be individually firing at ~1-20 Hz on average. Together, that would generate many thousands of synaptic events per second distributed throughout the dendritic tree. \n",
